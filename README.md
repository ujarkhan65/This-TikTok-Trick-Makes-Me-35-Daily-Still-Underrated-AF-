# This TikTok Trick Makes Me $35+ Daily (Still Underrated AF)

Yep, you read that right. There's a low-key TikTok strategy that’s still flying under the radar—and it’s making me over **$35 a day** consistently with minimal effort. Best part? It’s *not saturated* yet, so you can still jump in and start earning.

## 🚨 What’s the Trick?

**Affiliate marketing using TikTok + digital products.**

Let me break it down. Here's the formula:

1. **Find a trending niche** (think: side hustles, AI tools, digital planners, ebooks, fitness guides).
2. **Sign up for an affiliate program** like:
   - Gumroad
   - Digistore24
   - ClickBank
   - Etsy (for digital downloads)
3. **Create short TikToks** showing the product in action or how it helps people.
4. **Link the product in your bio** using a tool like Linktree or Beacons.
5. **Repeat daily.**

💡 **Example:** Let’s say you’re promoting an AI resume builder that pays $15 per referral. Make a TikTok like:  
> “This free tool made my resume in 30 seconds 🤯 #jobsearch #resumetips”

People are *crazy* for tools that make life easier. You get clicks, they sign up, and boom—you get paid.

## 🧠 Why It Works

- TikTok’s organic reach is still insane if you post smart content.
- People LOVE short, helpful, visual hacks.
- You don’t need a huge audience. Even 500 views on a well-placed TikTok can get you clicks + conversions.
- Most digital products have 30–70% commission.

## 📈 My Results (So Far)

- 1 TikTok hit 12.4k views = $97.30 in a day  
- Most videos average ~$35–$50/day with solid CTAs  
- Built a list of 1.2k+ followers in less than a month

And no, I’m not dancing. No face required. Just screen recordings, voiceovers, and Canva edits.
